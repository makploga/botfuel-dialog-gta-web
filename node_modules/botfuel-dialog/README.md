[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Botfuel/botfuel-dialog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Botfuel/botfuel-dialog)

Build highly conversational bots with Botfuel Dialog.

See some [sample bots](https://github.com/topics/botfuel-dialog-samples) written with Botfuel Dialog.

## Run the tests

### Running all the tests

Run botfuel-dialog and each test packages (integration) tests:

```shell
BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn test
```

### Unit tests

Run only the botfuel-dialog tests:

```shell
yarn unit-test
```

### Integration tests

```shell
BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn test packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>
```

Example: 

```shell
BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn test packages/test-qna
```

By default, integration tests are run using fixtures.
To register new fixtures, add `REPLAY=record` to the test command:

```shell
REPLAY=record BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn test
```

This will make real API calls and create new fixtures.

### Publish on NPM

```shell
BOTFUEL_APP_ID=<...> BOTFUEL_APP_KEY=<...> yarn release
```

Publishing requires credentials because it runs integration tests beforehand.
